Q13: Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each genotype and their corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes.

```{r}
expr <-read.table("rs8067378.txt")
expr
```
```{r}
summary(expr)
```

```{r}
table(expr$geno)
```

```{r}
aggregate(expr$exp, list(expr$geno), FUN=median)
```

**There are 462 samples in total. Sample size of A/A is 108, A/G is 233 and G/G is 121.Median is A/A	31.24847, A/G	25.06486, G/G	20.07363**


Q14: Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the expression of ORMDL3?

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(expr) + aes(geno,exp,fill=geno) +geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)
```
