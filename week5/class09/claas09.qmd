```


```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
```

```{r}

Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 
198

Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 
HOH

Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 
2

```{r}

```

Normal mode analysis (NMA) is a bioinformatics method for predicting functional motions.

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

```{r}
mktrj(m,file="adk_nma.pdb")
```

sequence of adk and use it to search the PDB database


```{r}
aa <- get.seq("1ake_a")
aa
```

Q13. How many amino acids are in this sequence, i.e. how long is this sequence? 
214

```{r}
#b <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

```{r}
#hits <- plot(b)
```


```{r}

```

```{r}

Q14. What do you note about this plot? Are the black and colored lines similar or different? Where do you think they differ most and why?

The colored lines (red and green) look similar but they are very different from the black lines. Colored lines also have higher and  more peaks than the black lines. It indicates that there are two major distinct confrontamational states of Adenylate kinase. These differ by a collective low frequency displacement of two nucleotide-binding site regions.
